# Gender-Age-Classification

### Goal
This project goal is to build a classification model to determine age and gender of a person's facial image. The model was built using Keras and Tensorflow for training, and Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for analyzing data. The dataset is based on the [UTKFace Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new) on Kaggle.

### Challenges and Future Implementation
#### Challenges:
The three main challenges I faced was:
1. Finding an even distributed dataset for gender and age
2. Increasing the accuracy for the model
3. Decreasing the validation loss for the model
